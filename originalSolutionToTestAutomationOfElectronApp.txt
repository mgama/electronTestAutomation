Here are the details of solving the problem to connect to a local electron app:
1 - First of all, download the chromedriver
2 - The chromedriver must be start on a terminal, with a command like this: 

./chromedriver --url-base=/wd/hub

The arguments (--url-base=/wd/hub) are really important since it gave me trouble to connect with webdriverio. Here is a post that got me thru this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18389419/selenium-webdriverjs-cannot-build-webdriver-for-chrome

3 - Once you created the electron app, put everything under a folder called 'app' and copied it to the following location under: electron/Electron.app/Contents/Resources/app 

This helped me out:

4 -  Make a folder and install webdriverio: 

http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html

5 - Create the test and setup the chromedriver to point to the electron app. For this, I use your recommended site (yesterday I show you the demo using webdriver js, today script is using webdriverio): 

https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-selenium-and-webdriver.md

6 - To run the test, once chromedriver server has been started (as stated on step 2), then on your folder where you have webdriverio, use this command:

node <name/path of the test> 
7 - Expect to see Electron pop up with the app and the test run 

Learnings from the exercise: 
- I tried to go very simple with the electron app, so all my code is on the index.html file. I created the buttons with html and just the interactivity with javascript to change the value of the textbox. 
- The first try with Mocha and Selenium WebdriverJS kind of worked, but I got stuck with not having proper handling of indefinite pauses. Apart that the syntax can get really long in comparison with nigthwatchjs or WebdriverIO.
- WebdriverIO is way superior than plain mocha and selenium webdriverjs. I tried installing nightwatch on my local machine and configure it, but after 1 hour of troubleshooting I gave up. WebdriverIO is on pair with nightwatchjs and it does have a very good library to set up the tests. I think it is a good tool for running tests against electron apps, the syntax is cleaner and it has a good API.
